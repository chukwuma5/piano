## My Challanges and lessons

Learnt how to create well optimized pictures for the web, used my fontsizes well, used my pixels for nice elements that will remain permanent in size as the work goes on and used the float property to section images properly. HTML AND CSS was fun working with.

## Best syntax Used

    ``CSS

(queries(media)), (flex-box), and (power of proper font usage).
Media queries is very important to practise building easy and responsive layout stuctures for all sections in the site also with the css float property to give accurate width to image boxes. You will see them all around modern websites and web apps.
